# 2025_The_Norwegian_Sports_Membership_Database

This repisotry contains R-scripts for the paper "The Norwegian Sports Membership Database: coverage, biases and research potential" available as a preprint from MedrXiv here: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.03.25337227v2

The original idea was to include a simulated dataset showing the structure of the data. However, this job was more time consuming than initially imagined. This might be uploaded later.

The current files contain:
00_Population: This file creates the population - both for all memberships and active memberships.
01_Table1_Descriptives: This file creates both Table 1 and S-Table 2.
02_Figure1_Ages: This file creates Figure 1.
03_Figure2_Coverage: This file creates both panels in Figure 2.
04_Supplementary_Information: This file creates all the supplementary figures.
